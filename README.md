# fixparser
Problem Statement
Write a Java parser to parse FIX messages. Design an API so people can easily access the fields of a FIX message. 
The input of your parser is a byte[], and you can assume it contains at least one complete FIX message, and the first bye of the FIX message is at position 0.
